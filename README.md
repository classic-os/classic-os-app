# Classic OS App

Classic OS is a modular, multi-chain DeFi interface focused on clarity, safety, and clean architectural boundaries.

This repository contains the **frontend application** for Classic OS. It is currently in **early development** and focused on establishing core domain models, protocol abstractions, and UI structure.

## Status

🚧 **Early Development (Phase 1)**

- Domain and protocol interfaces are being defined
- Protocol integrations are currently mocked
- UI is under active construction
- No production contracts, automation, or custodial services are present

## Scope

### In Scope (Phase 1)
- Core domain types and interfaces
- Chain-first protocol abstractions
- Dashboard UI built against mock data
- Incremental, testable architecture

### Out of Scope (for now)
- Backend automation services
- Custodial functionality
- Guaranteed protocol or chain support
- Production deployments

## Principles

- Non-custodial by design
- Explicit over implicit behavior
- Chain-specific protocol modeling
- Safety and clarity over feature velocity
